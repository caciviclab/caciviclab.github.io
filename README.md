CA Civic Lab
=============================

**CA Civic Lab** is a platform for organizing open data and civic technology projects that can be replicated and scaled throughout California.

## Who We Are
**We're a coalition** of Code for America brigades, journalists, reform groups, and public officials improving California governance by making civic information more open and accessible. If you're interested in contributing to **CA Civic Lab**, please [open an issue](/issues) to let us know who you are and how you want to help.

## Projects
We're currently working on two projects:

1. [Creating an inventory of state agency open data practices](/state-agencies). 
2. [Expanding OpenDisclosure to serve more municipalities throughout the state](/opendisclosure). OpenDisclosure shows local campaign finance information so voters and community watchdogs can better understand the flow of local political money.  

Note that each of these folders has a README that explains the purpose of the content.

## How You Can Help
Pull requests welcome! We just ask that you follow a few guidelines:

* This repo is for creating and updating pages on the [caciviclab.org](https://caciviclab.org/) website.
* To create or update a page within this repo, please create a new branch.
* Each folder that contains a page should have a README to help potential collaborators understand how they might contribute.
* Each folder should contain its own stylesheets, scripts, and other assets.
