## CA Civic Lab’s Code of Conduct

The CA Civic Lab community expects that CA Civic Lab network activities,
events, and digital forums:

1. Are a safe and respectful environment for all participants.
2. Are a place where people are free to fully express their identities.
3. Presume the value of others. Everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions have
   value.
4. Don’t assume everyone has the same context, and encourage questions.
5. Find a way for people to be productive with their skills (technical and not)
   and energy. Use language such as “yes/and”, not “no/but.”
6. Encourage members and participants to listen as much as they speak.
7. Strive to build tools that are open and free technology for public use.
   Activities that aim to foster public use, not private gain, are prioritized.
8. Prioritize access for and input from those who are traditionally excluded
   from the civic process.
9. Work to ensure that the community is well-represented in the planning,
   design, and implementation of civic tech. This includes encouraging
   participation from women, minorities, and traditionally marginalized groups.
10. Actively involve community groups and those with subject matter expertise in
    the decision-making process.
11. Ensure that the relationships and conversations between community members,
    the local government staff and community partners remain respectful,
    participatory, and productive.
12. Provide an environment where people are free from discrimination or
    harassment.

CA Civic Lab reserves the right to ask anyone in violation of these policies
not to participate in CA Civic Lab network activities, events, and digital
forums.


## CA Civic Lab’s Anti-Harassment Policy

CA Civic Lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for
everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion.
We do not tolerate harassment of staff, presenters, and participants in any
form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any CA Civic Lab
event or network activity, including talks. Anyone in violation of these
policies may be expelled from CA Civic Lab network activities, events, and
digital forums, at the discretion of the event organizer or forum administrator.

Harassment includes but is not limited to: offensive verbal or written comments
related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion; sexual images in
public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing
photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events;
inappropriate physical contact; unwelcome sexual attention; unwarranted
exclusion; and patronizing language or action.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any
action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from
CA Civic Lab network activities, events, and digital forums.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have
any other concerns, please contact a member of the event staff or forum
administrator immediately. You can contact them at [EVENT ORGANIZER/FORUM
ADMINISTRATOR EMAIL AND PHONE NUMBER]. Event staff or forum administrators will
be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law
enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment
to feel safe for the duration of the event.

If you cannot reach an event organizer or forum administrator and/or it is an
emergency, please call 911 and/or remove yourself from the situation.

You can also contact CA Civic Lab about harassment at
[safe-space-caciviclab@googlegroups.com](mailto:safe-space-caciviclab@googlegroups.com)
and feel free to use the email template below. CA Civic Lab staff acknowledge
that we are not always in a position to evaluate a given situation due to the
number of events and the fact that our team is not always present. However, we
are hopeful that by providing these guidelines we are establishing a community
that jointly adheres to these values and can provide an environment that is
welcoming to all.

We value your attendance and hope that by communicating these expectations
widely we can all enjoy a harassment-free environment.
