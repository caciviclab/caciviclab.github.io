Open Disclosure - CA Civic Lab
========================

OpenDisclosure is a platform for organizing campaign finance data that can be replicated and scaled throughout the state of California.

## Where do I meet you?

We are collaborating across the state of California.  There are both weekly and monthly meetings which will appear on the [google calendar][caciviclab-calendar].

We also listen to issues here on github and meet up to talk about them in [slack](https://opencal.slack.com) to organize collective efforts.

## How You Can Help

* If you are in the area, check out a [meeting][caciviclab-calendar].
* If you are remote, then come visit us on [slack](https://opencal.slack.com).
* If you want to avoid the business of discussing with people - we want you!  Pull the repo, make some changes, and tell us about it with a github [issue.](https://github.com/caciviclab/issues)
* Say you are a fan, who just really wants to lurk and cheer us on. View our
  [next beta](https://caciviclab.org/odca-jekyll/).
