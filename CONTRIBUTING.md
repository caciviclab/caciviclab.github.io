# Contributing

We are a coalition of brigades, all volunteers from the California Bay Area. We
would love to get help from folks across the state to help us in building
a database of campaign finance data for local jurisdictions across the state.


## Code of Conduct

CA Civic Lab is dedicated to providing a respectful, harassment-free community
for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment or bullying of any community member
in any form. By participating, you agree to our full [Code of
Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).


## We work remotely

Being a collaboration of brigades, we often meetup in person at our local
brigades without the entire group. It's important to keep the rest of the group
informed. We can't all make it to four brigade meetings a week `;-)` Keep this
in mind as you collaborate and consider posting decisions or learnings to our
[slack](https://opencal.slack.com) or comment on an [issue](/issues).


## Pull requests

Please submit a pull request for any commits, large or small. Pull requests are
a great way to get visibility on changes and keep folks up to date. Please keep
your pull requests of a reasonable size as large pull requests can take longer
to review and merge.
